# TODO:
#   - make covariance matrices so canoncical ones take R instead of data
# - replace get_posterior_matrices with individual access function
#
#
# Thoughts:
#
#   - add ability to prune low-weight components?
# - test ed
# - maybe want to separate datadriven and canonical matrices?
# -   could do runs that are separate and test how things improve with data-driven matrices?
# - could store results from more than one mash run?
# - how to copy a whole mash environment?
