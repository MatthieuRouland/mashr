\title{Perform condition-by-condition analyses}
\usage{
mash_run_1by1(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bhat}{an n by R matrix of observations (n units in R conditions)}

\item{Shat}{an n by R matrix of standard errors (n units in R conditions)}
}
\value{
a list similar to the output of mash, particularly including posterior matrices
}
\details{
Performs simple "condition-by-condition" analysis
by running \code{ash} from package \code{ashr} on data from each condition, one at a time.
